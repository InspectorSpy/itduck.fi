# itduck.fi
These are the main files for my project website itduck.fi

Currently a very basic website, hosted on a Ubuntu Server from Oracle.

Using Hestia Control Panel for ease-of-use and endorsing the open source.

For access to the server itself I use Termius SSH.

IT Duck logo I designed myself.
